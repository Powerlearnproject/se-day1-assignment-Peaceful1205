Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
Software Engineering is the way of applying engineering approach to software development. Software Engineering also enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life i.e communication, commerce, healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1948- Grace Hopper developed the first compiler which translates human-realiable coding machine, 1960- the development of software engineering and discipline.
1957- FORTRAN the first high level programming language.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- [1] Requirement- this involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirement.
-  [2] Design- this involves creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
-   [3] Implementation- this involves writing codes and building the software according to design specification.
  - [4] Testing-  conducting test to ensure quality standard amd functional requirement.
  - [5] Deployment- this involves releasing the software to end users
  - [6] Maintenance- this involves providing supports, updates and enhancement to the sofware development


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is sequential approach with distinct phase flowing downward like a waterfall i.e requirement, design.
Agile is iterative and incremental, emphasizing continious feedback and adaptation.
agile promotes ongoing collaboration while water fall focuses on thorough planing and execution in predetermined stages

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer writes code and implements software solutions
A Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality
A Project Manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments [IEDs] is a software that provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing. i.e visual Studio, Eclipse.
Version Control System [VCS] is asoftware tool used to track changes to source codes and cordinate work among team members. i.e Git, Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
[1] Tight Deadlines-  a software engineer might be pressured to deliver a software product on schedule which may result in rushed development and the quality may not be up to standard.
[2] Technical Debt- this may be incurred through shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, this can impede future development and compromised quality.
strategies for overcoming these challenges include effective communication, prioritization of task and regular assessment of project goals and timeline

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is about crafting questions or statement to get the best reply from AI models. Just like a recipe tells you exactly what ingredients to use and how to mix them, a prompt tells the AI robot exactly what information you need and how you want it presented.  Prompt Engineering helps to avoid asking vague question and getting confusing answers by making your questions clear and specific.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example of vague prompt is "i  need a book to read" which might give you a random and confused answer but a clear prompt like "can you suggest a science fiction novel" will give you a clear and specific answer
